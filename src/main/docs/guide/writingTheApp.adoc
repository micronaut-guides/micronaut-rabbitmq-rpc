Lets describe the microservices you are going to build through the tutorial.

* `bookcatalogue` - It returns a list of books. It uses a domain consisting of a book name and isbn.

* `bookinventory` - It exposes an endpoint to check whether a book has sufficient stock to fulfill an order. It uses a domain consisting of a stock level and isbn.

* `bookrecommendation` - It consumes previous services and exposes an endpoint which recommends book names which are in stock.
